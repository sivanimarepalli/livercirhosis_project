#Cirrhosis Disease Prediction
Welcome to the Cirrhosis Disease Prediction project, where data science meets healthcare to predict the stages of cirrhosis based on various clinical features.

This project uses a collection of patient data to help classify and predict the stages of cirrhosis. By analyzing various medical parameters, such as age, bilirubin levels, cholesterol, and more, we aim to create a model that can accurately predict whether a patient is in a high-risk stage of cirrhosis.

#Key Features:
Multiple Models: This project utilizes several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, to provide diverse predictions and identify the most accurate approach for cirrhosis detection.

Data Preprocessing: Features like gender, ascites, hepatomegaly, and more are preprocessed to convert categorical data into numerical formats, ensuring better performance and interpretability.

Visualization: Powerful data visualizations such as distribution plots, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves have been used to illustrate the relationship between different medical features and the progression of cirrhosis.

Performance Metrics: Key metrics such as accuracy, AUC, precision, and recall are computed to evaluate the model’s performance. The results guide us in selecting the most effective predictive model.

#Dataset:
The dataset consists of clinical data from cirrhosis patients, with features including:

#Age

#Cholesterol levels

#Prothrombin

#Ascites (Fluid buildup)

Hepatomegaly (Enlarged liver)

#And many more…

#Models Implemented:
Logistic Regression - A baseline model for binary classification.

XGBoost - A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that often delivers high performance in classification tasks.

Random Forest - An ensemble learning method used for classification.

Cox Proportional Hazards Model - For survival analysis, predicting the time until a certain event (e.g., death or liver failure).

#Results:
AUC (Area Under the Curve): The project highlights the AUC score to evaluate model robustness.

Concordance Index (C-index): Used to assess the predictive accuracy of survival analysis models.

#Usage:
You can explore and modify the code to fit your own dataset or experiment with different features. For deployment, you can integrate these models into a healthcare system to assist clinicians in diagnosing cirrhosis at various stages.

#Dependencies:
pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn

xgboost

shap

lifelines

#Conclusion:
This project offers a comprehensive solution for the early detection and classification of cirrhosis, helping doctors and healthcare providers make informed decisions. With the combination of machine learning models and medical insights, we can significantly improve patient outcomes by identifying those at high risk.
